## 🔥 The Problem

Today, Indian students face five critical barriers that prevent them from reaching their full potential:

### 1. 🔍 Discovery is Broken
Relevant opportunities — hackathons, scholarships, competitions, fellowships — are scattered across dozens of websites, WhatsApp groups, and Instagram posts. Students miss deadlines simply because they never knew the opportunity existed.

### 2. 👥 Team Formation is a Wall
Most students skip competitions not because they lack skill, but because they cannot find teammates. There is no platform to discover peers with complementary skills who are looking for a team.

### 3. 📚 Guidance is Invisible
Even after finding an opportunity, students don't know where to begin — what previous winners built, how judging works, what resources are useful. The hard-earned knowledge of past winners evaporates after every competition.

### 4. 🚪 Participation Feels Exclusive
Students believe "I don't know coding, so I can't participate." But competitions need designers, researchers, presenters, writers, marketers, video editors, and product managers. This misunderstanding locks out thousands of talented students.

### 5. 🗑️ Knowledge Loss Every Cycle
Every winning project disappears after the competition ends. Future students start from absolute zero. The same mistakes are repeated. The same lessons are re-learned. Year after year.

## 💡 Solution

Vijeta creates **one continuous journey** that transforms a curious student into a published winner, and then into a mentor who guides the next generation.

         └──────────────────────────────────────────┘
                     COMPETE & WIN
```

This isn't just a platform. It's a **self-sustaining ecosystem of excellence** where every winner automatically produces the resources that create the next generation of winners.

## 🎯 How It Works

### The Pillars

| Pillar | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **Discover** | A unified feed of hackathons, scholarships, competitions, fellowships, internships, and research — with smart filters, location-based search, and an interactive geographic map |
| **Team Up** | Find teammates by skills, college, city, and availability. Create open teams with defined roles. Apply or invite. Built-in friend network |
| **Guidance** | AI-powered mentorship through **Margdarshak** — a context-aware assistant that knows your profile, your stats, and the opportunity landscape. Slash commands like `/findhackathon`, `/mystats`, `/findteam` give instant answers |
| **Build** | Real-time chat via Firebase for seamless team communication. Activity feed keeps everyone in sync |
| **Showcase** | Publish winning projects with GitHub repos, live demos, and PPT decks. Every showcase becomes a learning resource for future students |
